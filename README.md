# Image-Scene-Classification

Using the Kaggle dataset of natural images scenes called [**Intel Image Classification**](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) Challenge.  
9 experiments led to build a hybrid architecture composed of Inception Modules and Residual Blocks outperforms **ResNet-50** in term of *accuracy*, *complexity*, *necessary parameters* and *training time*.
