# Image-Scene-Classification

Using the Kaggle dataset of natural images scenes called **Intel Image Classification** Challenge.  
**9 experiments** led to build a hybrid architecture composed of inception modules and residual blocks outperforms ResNet-50 in term of *accuracy*, *complexity*, *necessary parameters* and *training time*.
